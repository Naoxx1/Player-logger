# Player Logger

A simple BepInEx mod for Gorilla Tag that tracks players and sends info to Discord.

## What it does

This mod automatically detects when new players join your room and logs their info. You can save the data to files and get Discord notifications when someone new shows up.

## How to install

1. Download the dll file
2. Put it in your `BepInEx/plugins/` folder  
3. Start the game
4. Add your Discord webhook in the config

## Setup

The mod creates a config file automatically at `BepInEx/config/com.idk.playerlogger.cfg`

You need to add your Discord webhook URL there. Everything else works out of the box.

## What you need

- BepInEx (obviously)
- Gorilla Tag
- A Discord webhook if you want notifications

That's it. Pretty simple.
