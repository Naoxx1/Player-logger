# Player Logger v1.0.0

Hey, first version of this thing. Nothing fancy, just log players and sends stuff to Discord.

## What's in here
- Detects when people join your room
- Saves their info to files
- Pings your Discord if you want
- Uses BepInEx config (obviously)

## How to get it working
1. Grab the dll file
2. Stick it in your plugins folder
3. Launch the game
4. Put your Discord webhook in the config

## What happens
- Spots new players automatically
- Shoots info to Discord (if you bothered to set it up)
- Dumps files on your computer
- Doesn't spam your console

## What you need
- BepInEx (duh)
- Gorilla Tag
- Discord webhook (only if you want notifications)
